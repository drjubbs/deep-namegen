# Summary

This is a project to create a simple neural network using Tensorflow/Keras which procedurally generates proper names for locations and people. Data sets available for experimentation:

- `us_cities.txt`: 29,880 US cities taken from the SQL database provided at https://github.com/kelvins/US-Cities-Database.git.
- `bible_characters.txt`: List of bible characters, adapted from https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lists/List_of_biblical_characters.

## Starting the Sequence

OPTIONAL ... The `y` vector for the first two letters of a name will be taken from the probability distribution.
