# Summary

Hobby project to create a simple neural network using Tensorflow/Keras which procedurally generates city or people names.

Currently the only available training set is that of 29,880 US cities, `in/us_cities.txt`, taken from the SQL database provided at https://github.com/kelvins/US-Cities-Database.git.
